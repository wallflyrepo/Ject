Ject is a simple, lightweight, quick solution for [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) for Swift.

It is designed with quick integration and set up in mind for the creative developer, ideal for small to medium sized projects. Ject takes inspiration from [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/), intended to provide simplicity over all for adding Dependency Injection to your project.

Ject is currently in Beta. 


## Requirements
- [x] Swift 3
- [x] iOS 8.0+

Getting Started
-----------------------

#### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
`

To integrate Ject into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Ject'
```
`

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
`

#### Creating a Dependency Graph

You can easily create a new `Graph` using 

```swift
    let dependencyGraph = Graph.newInstance()
```
`

It is recommended to keep one reference to your Graph with your dependencies. A good solution is to create a property in your `AppDelegate.swift` file

```swift
import Ject

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    private var _mGraph: Graph?

    var mGraph: Graph {
        if(mGraph == nil) {
            mGraph = Graph.newInstance()
        }
        return mGraph!
    }
    
    ...
}
```
`

#### Making a class Injectable

In order to use Ject Dependency Injection, your dependencies must inherit from `Injectable`. Declare your class and have it implement `Injectable` from the `Ject` pod like so

```swift
class ViewUtils: Injectable {

    required init() {
        //Default Constructor
    }

    func inject(graph: Graph) -> Injectable {
        return ViewUtils()
    }

    func isSingleton() -> Bool {
        return true
    }

}
```
`

#### Injecting Dependencies into Dependencies

Many times your dependencies has dependencies of their own. Using Ject, you can simple inject these dependencies using two methods:



- Constructor Injection

Simply add your dependencies to your constructor as parameters as you normally would. Ideally these dependencies would also inherit from `Injectable`. 

```swift
class ViewUtils: Injectable {

    var mIconManager: IconManager?

    var mColorManager: ColorManager?

    init(iconManager: IconManager, colorManager: ColorManager) {
        mIconManager = iconManager
        mColorManager = colorManager
    }

    required init() {
        //Default Constructor
    }

    func inject(graph: Graph) -> Injectable {
        //Use your constructor here to inject your Injectable Dependencies
        return ViewUtils(iconManager: graph.inject(IconManager.self), colorManager: graph.inject(ColorManager.self))
    }

    func isSingleton() -> Bool {
        return true
    }

}
```
`

- Property Injection

You can also inject dependencies directly into properties as follows

```swift
class ViewUtils: Injectable {

    var mGraph: Graph {
        return (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).mGraph
    }

    var mIconManager: IconManager {
        return mGraph.inject(IconManager.self)
    }

    var mColorManager: ColorManager {
        return mGraph.inject(ColorManager.self)
    }

    required init() {
        //Default Constructor
    }

    func inject(graph: Graph) -> Injectable {
        return ViewUtils()
    }

    func isSingleton() -> Bool {
        return true
    }

}
```
